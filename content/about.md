I am an enthused and self-motivated Software Engineer with experience designing, developing, and testing software, primarily responsive web applications and interactive features that drive business growth and improve user experience. In addition, I have experience in process-oriented software development.
Beyond coding, I’m also passionate about writing and sharing
what I’ve learned with my teammates and the broader web
community. I’ve gained so much from others sharing their skills and knowledge.

Outside of software, I enjoy music—a lot. I love listening to music from all parts of the world and all genres. I play the saxophone as well. I do enjoy sports, playing and watching. I play badminton and soccer with some friends in my spare time. I enjoy watching soccer games on weekends and am a big fan of Juventus FC and Arsenal.
