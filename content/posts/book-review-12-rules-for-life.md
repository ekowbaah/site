## Who is Jordan Peterson?

Jordan Peterson is a Canadian psychologist, writer and professor of psychology at the University of Toronto. He is also a clinical psychologist and a prolific public speaker.

**Peterson's 12 Rules for Life:** An Antidote to Chaos has been praised by many as "an antidote to chaos" because it provides insights into how we can live our lives more productively. In this book, Peterson offers advice on becoming happy in all areas of life---work, relationships and health---and avoiding becoming overwhelmed by your problems or circumstances (which is why he calls them "chaos").

## What are the 12 Rules for Life about?

12 Rules for Life is a book that has been around for many years and has become one of the most popular self-help books ever written. The author, Jordan B. Peterson, is a clinical psychologist who teaches at the University of Toronto and Oxford University. He has also appeared on several television shows, including "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart," where he discussed topics such as free speech and authenticity in society today.

He outlines twelve rules for living your life in this book, which can be summarized as follows:

- Follow your heart.
- Find meaning in what you do.
- Take personal responsibility for everything that happens to you.
- Have fun.
- Don't take yourself too seriously.
- Learn from other people's mistakes (and successes).
- Make things happen without first seeking permission or approval from others.

## Rule 1: Stand up straight with your shoulders back

> “So, attend carefully to your posture. Quit drooping and hunching around. Speak your mind. Put your desires forward as if you had a right to them—at least the same right as others. Walk tall and gaze forthrightly ahead. Dare to be dangerous. Encourage the serotonin to flow plentifully through the neural pathways desperate for its calming influence.”
> – JORDAN PETERSON

The denial of a profound truth can lead to suffering. Denying your responsibility to deal with grief can lead to a hopeless victim mentality. This mentality is increasingly common and relies on expecting others to solve your problems. Adopting this approach prevents you from finding meaning. Some of the strongest people have overcome massive amounts of pain, suffering and adversity. Taking ownership of their suffering allowed them to find meaning. On top of mentality, though, our body posture is crucial.

To learn to stand up for yourself, Peterson uses the metaphor of embracing your inner lobster. The lobster shares many of the same neurological structures as humans. Like human brains, lobster brains have areas specialized for social hierarchies. Peterson explains that studies suggest lobsters who lose their social status through losing fights stop producing serotonin. This lack of serotonin can lead to depression in the lobsters. The dominant lobsters also adopted an assertive posture while the other lobsters curled up.
The body and mind are deeply connected. So, set yourself up for success by exerting the proper body language. Stand up straight with your shoulders back for two powerful reasons:

1. It exerts dominance and confidence.
2. It also shows you accept responsibility.

Research has shown that physical stature, even a slight muscle movement, can affect your emotions. For example, it's tough to accept responsibility for your actions when slouching or sprawling out on the floor. However, upright with your shoulders back and your feet shoulder-width apart, you exude confidence and a willingness to take meaningful action.

> "To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the
> terrible responsibility of life, with eyes wide open. It means
> deciding to voluntarily transform the chaos of potential into the
> realities of habitable order. It means adopting the burden of
> self-conscious vulnerability, and accepting the end of the unconscious
> paradise of childhood, where finitude and mortality are only dimly
> comprehended. It means willingly undertaking the sacrifices necessary
> to generate a productive and meaningful reality (it means acting to
> please God, in the ancient language)." – JORDAN PETERSON

Stand up straight with your shoulders back. Be proud of yourself, confident in what you have to offer the world, and determined to make a difference. Acknowledge that life is hard and unfair sometimes, but that doesn't mean it's suitable for someone else. Know how to say no---when necessary---to those who try to take advantage of you or use you as a means for their selfish ends (e.g., "I'm not going out tonight because I have work tomorrow."). Don't let anyone force themselves upon you; if they don't respect your boundaries, they're not worth talking with anyway!

## Rule 2: Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping

Peterson encourages people to credit themselves and those around them for acting productively and with care. He also credits patients for showing genuine concern and thoughtfulness toward others. They can express their emotions because they are themselves. You accept that you are a patient when you are a patient. You don’t try to be someone else.

The lesson from the “patient” approach is to respect yourself and know that you are worthy of help. You are as important to other people as you are to yourself. You have a vital role to play in the unfolding destiny of the world. As a result, you are morally obliged to take care of yourself. You should take care of, help, and be charitable to yourself. Act toward yourself the same way you would care for, help, and be dutiful to someone you love and value.

As part of caring for yourself, you must determine where you will bargain for yourself so that you don’t end up resentful, vengeful and cruel. You have to articulate your principles for two reasons:

1.  So that you can defend yourself against others taking advantage of you
2.  So that you are secure and safe while you work and play

When you look after yourself, you can start building meaning in your life. Don’t underestimate the power of your vision and direction. These are irresistible forces. They can transform obstacles into open pathways and expanded opportunities.

> “Strengthen the individual. Start with yourself. Take care with
> yourself. Define who you are. Refine your personality. Choose your
> destination and articulate your Being. As the great nineteenth-century
> German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche so brilliantly noted, ‘He whose
> life has a why can bear almost any how.’”
>
> – JORDAN PETERSON

People are better at filling and properly administering prescription medication to their pets than themselves.

You are responsible for your happiness, health and success. So if you want to succeed, start by taking care of yourself first.

## Rule 3: Make friends with people who want the best for you

Your friends have a significant impact on the way you behave. Their sayings and mannerisms will often rub off on you. Unfortunately, this means they can also negatively influence you through toxic habits.
But if you surround yourself with people who support your upward aim, they will not tolerate your cynicism and destructiveness. Instead, they will encourage you when you do good for yourself and others and carefully punish you when you don’t. This encouragement will help bolster your resolve.
People who are not aiming upward will do the opposite. Peterson explains that managers often put underachievers on group projects with high performers. Their goal is to raise the underachievers to the level of their colleagues. But research suggests that the opposite effect is more common. The high performers are likely to be dragged down to the underachiever’s level.
So, strive to surround yourself with good people. Look beyond superficial features like a sense of style or socioeconomic status and identify who will help you create positive change. Standing next to brilliant people like this requires strength and courage because you might feel inferior. Have some humility and courage so you can grow as an individual.

## Rule 4: Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today

## Find Your Being

Once you're an adult, you're a singular being. So, be cautious when comparing yourself to others. You have your particular problems—financial, intimate and psychological. Those are embedded in the unique broader context of your existence.

Your career or job either does or does not personally work for you. If it does, it does so in a unique interplay with the other specifics of your life. As you find your Being, you must decide how much of your time to spend on your career and how much on other parts of your life. You must also determine what to let go of and what to pursue. These decisions require careful observation, education, reflection, and communication with others. Essentially, by doing this, you are scratching the surface of your beliefs. This helps you to make decisions without feeling overwhelmed by your problems.

## Avoid Comparing Yourself to Others

We all have an innate need to compare ourselves to other people. Your brain will release a serotonin hormone upon noticing you are more skilled than others. When you have serotonin in your blood, you feel confident and in control of your life.

But your brain restricts serotonin when someone threatens your societal status and makes you look incompetent. So, you will start doubting yourself and experience a low sense of self‐worth.

You are now connected to billions of people online. This means it doesn't take long for your brain to notice how you compare to others. You're more likely to lose hope when exposed to so many better people. You will stop taking action and let your life slip into chaos. The best way to prevent this is to stop comparing yourself to who someone else is today. Instead, start comparing yourself to who you were yesterday.

> "Even a man on a sinking ship can be happy when he clambers aboard a
> lifeboat! And who knows where he might go in the future. To journey
> happily may be better than arriving successfully…" ‐ JORDAN PETERSON.

## Get Your Psychological House in Order

Your psychological house is the most important thing to monitor and improve. Comparing yourself today to who you were yesterday, what Peterson calls "taking stock" of your psychological house. You can see your progress and decide if you believe you're progressing at the required rate. You then need to identify where you must renovate your psychological house. Determine whether these changes are cosmetic fixes or structural flaws. Write a list of these areas that require improvement and match them with fixes.

This approach to improvement will help your internal critic become less obsessed with inadequacies and more focused on improvement. It is also essential to Peterson's sixth rule, "Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world," so it holds significant importance.

It's easy to forget that we are all unique individuals with our own set of talents, weaknesses and interests. We can't be like others if we want to live happy lives.

Focus on being your person today: think about what makes YOU different from yesterday rather than putting stock into how much better someone else may be doing now!

## Rule 5: Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them

Parents must treat their kids in a way that prepares them for the real world. For Peterson, this means ensuring they can function well in society by instilling the appropriate rules. When parents ignore this, their children risk being rejected by society in many painful ways. This can feel like a high-pressure challenge because our children are blank slates who will impact future generations. Deciding what to write onto these blank slates can be paralyzing.

Peterson first encourages readers to accept the innate aggression found in humans. This is why almost everyone has a story of being bullied as a child. To overcome this aggression, the author believes your primary concern should be raising kind children. This doesn’t mean you should become your child’s best friend. This would prevent you from enforcing the required rules for your child to become a better person. Peterson provides the following examples of practical rules to set:

- Never use violence unless in self-defence.
- Show others kindness and respect.

Peterson also recommends you avoid superficial rules like:

- You must always be in bed by 7 p.m.
- You must never have mismatched socks.

As well as setting up rules that will guide children to a better future, parents must also learn how to help their children overcome failure and pain. These experiences are inevitable and should be used as a learning experience. Raise children who are passionate about changing the world. And create children who seek to improve themselves, so they are better equipped to change the world.

A parent's job is to help their children make good choices, not force them into making bad ones. Parents should only guide their children when they have something important to teach them or when doing so will improve their life somehow.

## **Rule 6:** Set your house in order before you criticize the world.

> "If one wants to live a full life, one first sets one's own house in
> order; and only then can one sensibly aim to take on bigger
> responsibilities."
>
> – JORDAN PETERSON

It is an excellent idea because it means you can't be hypocritical or judgmental about others with problems.

Before you complain about the world or your situation, you need to start small and consider your circumstances:

- Have you taken full advantage of the opportunities offered to you?
- Are you working hard on your career? Or are you letting bitterness and resentment hold you back and drag you down?
- Have you made peace with your brother?
- Are you treating your spouse and your children with dignity and respect?
- Do you have habits that are destroying your health and well-being?

Have some humility. If you cannot bring peace to your household, you are not equipped to rule a city. Let your soul guide you. Then watch what happens over the days and weeks after you have set your house in order. You will begin to say what you think when you are at work. You will start to tell your wife, husband, children, or parents what you want and need. When you know that you have left something undone, you will act to correct this. Your head will start to clear up as you stop filling it with lies that everything is fine. Your experience will improve as you stop distorting it with inauthentic actions that don't address the problems you have in your house.

If you don't know how to live, how can you tell others what they should do?

If some things in your life aren't working out well, take responsibility for them and make changes! If some good things are going on in your life, but they feel like too much work, then accept that sometimes life isn't perfect---but that doesn't mean everything has to be broken down either!

## Rule 7: Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient)

Peterson uses the term expedient to describe putting off the activities we know we should do to seek short-term gratification instead. We do this because life is filled with suffering. But there’s so much more to life than just suffering. So, try to enjoy life as much as possible by pursuing something meaningful. Seeking meaning will help you be a better and happier person while also helping you deal with suffering.

You can start doing this by seeking sacrifice rather than instant gratification. This sacrifice must be for the benefit of others rather than your benefit. For example, Peterson does not see working long hours to earn a promotion as a sacrifice because your actions are still motivated by a positive outcome for yourself.
Peterson explains that these minor positive impacts will help you grow like a lotus flower. These flowers start at the bottom of a muddy lake and slowly increase. Eventually, lotus flowers burst out beautifully in the sunlight. This is how sacrifice for the sake of others can make your life far more fulfilling in the future.

> as intense, gripping and meaningful; when time passes, and you’re so
> engrossed in what you’re doing, you don’t notice—it is there and then
> that you are located precisely on the border between order and chaos.”
> – JORDAN PETERSON

## Rule 8: Tell the truth -- or, at least, don't lie

This is one of the essential rules in the book, and it's also one of the hardest to practice. Of course, there are times when you're sure to tell yourself a lie (or someone else will say something inaccurate). But lying to others is much more harmful than telling yourself a white lie; it can lead to broken relationships and evil karma from people who deserve better from you than what they get when they find out what happened.

You can use words to manipulate the world into delivering what you want. This includes both lying to others and lying to yourself. But this approach is driven by an ill-formed desire that doesn't consider the negative impact.

Suppose you pay close attention to what you do and say. In that case, you can learn to feel a state of internal division and weakness when you are misbehaving and misspeaking. This is an embodied sensation, not a thought. But if you bend everything blindly and willfully toward a goal, you will never discover if another goal would serve better.
As you continue to live by the truth, you will have to accept and deal with the conflicts that this mode of Being will generate. If you do so, you will continue to mature and become more responsible, in small and large ways. You will approach your more wisely formulated goals and become even wiser as you discover and rectify your inevitable errors.

> "If your life is not what it could be, try telling the truth. If you
> cling desperately to an ideology, or wallow in nihilism, try telling
> the truth. If you feel weak and rejected, and desperate, and confused,
> try telling the truth. In Paradise, everyone speaks the truth. That is
> what makes it Paradise. Tell the truth. Or, at least, don't lie." –
> JORDAN PETERSON

## **Rule 9:** Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't.

A listening person can reflect the crowd. He can do that without talking. He lets the talking person listen to themselves. That is what Freud recommended.

Freud had his patients lay on a couch, look at the ceiling, let their minds wander, and say whatever walked in. That’s his method of free association. Likewise, Freudian psychoanalysts used this method to avoid transferring their biases and opinions into the patient’s internal landscape.

If you listen instead, without premature judgment, people will generally tell you everything they think—and with little deceit. People will tell you the most unique, absurd and intriguing details. As a result, a few of your conversations will be boring.

## What You Know Now Is Not Enough

> “So, listen to yourself and those with whom you speak. Your wisdom
> then consists not of the knowledge you already have, but the continual
> search for knowledge, which is the highest form of wisdom.”
> – JORDAN PETERSON

Unless your life is perfect, what you know is not enough. You remain threatened by disease, self-deception, unhappiness, malevolence, betrayal, corruption, pain and limitation. You are subject to all these factors because you are too ignorant to protect yourself. If you knew enough, you could be healthier and more honest. You would suffer less. You could recognize, resist and even triumph over malice and evil. You would neither betray a friend nor deal falsely and deceitfully in business, politics, or love.

Your current knowledge has neither made you perfect nor kept you safe. So, it is insufficient. For this reason, the priestess of the Delphic Oracle in Ancient Greece spoke most highly of Socrates. Socrates always sought the truth. She described him as the wisest living man because he knew that what he knew was nothing. So, assume the person you are listening to might know something you don’t.

## **Rule 10:** Be precise in your speech.

When we have a problem, we are often tempted to cover it up or hope the problem will go away by itself. It's easier to keep peace and avoid the anxiety, despair and sadness associated with confronting your issues. It's easier to pretend the problem doesn't exist than to admit it and accept the pain.

But that's not a practical solution. So, you must be explicit and precise in your goals whenever you plan to achieve something. Unclear goals can create ambiguous actions, which can then create unclear results. If you have a vague unease, you will struggle with it until you define it explicitly and give it a concrete form. Once you precisely identify the issue, you will likely realize you were far more afraid than you should've been. You now have a specific target to confront. And specificity lets you start challenging the chaos.

When things go wrong, what has been ignored comes rushing in. When things are no longer precise, the walls crumble, and chaos emerges. When careless and allow things to slide, what we refuse to attend to gathers, takes a serpentine form, and strikes—often at the worst possible time. Then we see what focused intent, the precision of aim, and careful attention can protect us from.

Chaos gradually emerges in a household. Mutual dissatisfaction and resentment accumulate. Everything that isn't neatly arranged is swept under the rug, where the dragon feasts on the crumbs. But no one says anything as the household's shared society and negotiated order reveals itself as insufficient or disintegrates in the face of the unexpected and threatening. Instead, everyone whistles in the dark.

Something is lurking in the woods. You can be sure of it. But it's often just a squirrel. If you refuse to look, it's a dragon, and you're no knight: you're a mouse facing a lion or a rabbit paralyzed by a wolf's gaze. And I'm not claiming it's always a squirrel. Often, it's something truly heinous. But what is terrible in reality often pales compared to what is awful in imagination.

Confront the chaos of Being. Aim at a sea of troubles. Specify your destination, and chart your course. Admit to what you want. Tell those around you who you are. Narrow, gaze attentively, and move forward, forthrightly. Be precise in your speech.

## **Rule 11:** Do not bother children when they are skateboarding.

> “The fundamental moral question is not how to shelter children
> completely from misadventure and failure, so they never experience any
> fear or pain, but how to maximize their learning so that useful
> knowledge may be gained with minimal cost.” – JORDAN PETERSON

Peterson believes that parenting affects how children react to danger in the future. For example, parents often encourage their children to do something safer than skateboarding or rock climbing. The author believes that pushing children away from these activities means they will struggle to face the dangers of the adult world.

Peterson also considered gender equality in this chapter. He believes that modern society has a growing desire for gender equality. So, he highlights the difference between equality of opportunity and equality of outcome. This is good when gender equality means equal opportunity, rights, and treatment. But equality of opportunity should not be achieved at the cost of equality of outcome. According to _the 12 Rules for Life_, biology does not support the idea of literal, complete equality. It could be counterproductive because it forces people against their nature.

## **Rule 12:** Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street.

Peterson admits that focusing on the ugly parts of life is easy. After all, some examples of suffering can feel completely overwhelming. He uses the example of his daughter’s lifelong struggle with severe arthritis. The easy option with these crises is to become nihilistic or pessimistic about everything. Unfortunately, the reality is that this approach can often be worse than the initial suffering.

Pay close attention to the love and beauty around you to counteract potential nihilism. This might be a sunset, flowers, or simply giving a cat a stroke. Dwell on these moments when you can to increase their impact. Life’s too short to suffer.

## Conclusion

Do you want to make a change in your life? Do you want your actions to be more consistent? If so, I believe this book can be of assistance. It is simple to read, contains sound advice, and serves as a helpful reference when you have time to reflect on your life. It will not be easy, but it will be worthwhile.
