Theoretically, everyone is replaceable(for obvious reasons). Someone, better or worse, will always exist. However, with constraints such as limited time, interactions, and space, the reality is that some people are genuinely irreplaceable.

Value people, care about people, and recognize their worth.

Be good and do justice to the people that life pairs you up with. And when that relationship ends, for whatever reason, see the other person for what they are: a divine yet replaceable human being.
