## Introduction

If you're reading this, it's because you've heard about monorepos. If you're a developer, there's a good chance that the idea of having to manage several repositories is something that makes your skin crawl. After all, managing those projects can't be easy! But it's not just developers who use these tools---the biggest companies in the world are using them too. So let's examine what they do and why people use them.

## What is a monorepo?

A monorepo is a single repository for all your projects. It's a way to organize your code and make it easier to manage, but there are other benefits too.

For example, if you have multiple open source projects on GitHub, you probably use separate repos for each one (or even different branches). When working on an issue in one repo, it might be helpful to see how other people have addressed the same issue so that you can get some context about how others solved it. Having everything in one repo means that these issues will be easier to find because they're all related!

Monorepos are also helpful when working on internal projects at work or university. For example, suppose everyone uses a common language like JavaScript or Python across their team. In that case, they'll need access to each others' libraries over time as they become more familiar with them through use (i.e. if someone makes changes but doesn't push up their commits). Just one central location where everyone has access during this process would allow developers on different teams within those organizations.

## Why are people using them?

Why are people using them?

- Make it easier to work on multiple projects. Having your code in one place allows you to focus on the task without worrying about where it came from or how your code might use elsewhere. You also won't have to worry about whether your colleagues have read a particular file before because then they'll know what changes were made and what new information was added since the last time they looked at the code base---allowing them to contribute more easily with their ideas and suggestions (which is good).

- Make it easier for everyone involved in a project to find their way around when needed (or if there are any questions). Having everything stored together makes finding what someone needs easier than having everything scattered across different places on disk or, even worse, your entire hard drive! Monorepos will save both times spent searching through files looking for what one wants/needs vs just typing something out directly into Google Docs, or whatever platform may be available today."

## What problems do monorepos solve?

Monorepos are a great way to solve some problems with large web applications. They allow you to:

- Reuse code from multiple projects

- Simplify build and deployment by bundling all your dependencies into one package and making it easy for others to download and use.

- Efficiently manage multiple teams simultaneously since they're all in one repository.

## What problems do monorepos cause?

- With a monorepo, the more code you have in one place, the harder it is to find what you are looking for.

- If there's an issue with one of your applications or services and someone needs to look at it, they will have to go through all of your apps and services before they can figure out which app or service has the problem.

- It makes it harder to detect bugs in multiple applications at once because instead of having a single place where all these bugs are being reported (like GitHub), developers now have numerous places where they'll have their issues written (like different teams).

- When someone wants code from another team but doesn't know where that code was used (because other developers may have moved it out of their repo), going through each repo takes more time than if all those repos were combined into one giant repository, as everyone else does!

## Do I need one of these things?

The first thing to know about monorepos is that they aren't a silver bullet. They're not replacements for exhaustive testing, continuous integration, or code design.

As you'll see in this article and the next few ones coming up on this blog, I think that monorepos can help us build better software by making our lives easier in some ways while making them harder in others. That said, are you already doing things like TDD or CI/CD? Then maybe it will be worth looking at how these tools might fit into your current workflow!

## Takeaway:

- Monorepos are an excellent choice for large projects, but they can be challenging to manage.

- Monorepos are not a good choice for small projects; they make it harder to keep your code organized and easy to find things in the project.

## Conclusion

So, is it worth the trouble? The answer to that question depends on how much work you want to do and your time. If a monorepo is something you need to write code for, they're worth the trouble. But, on the other hand, if you can get away with just using one repo at a time, then, by all means, keep doing what you were doing before.
